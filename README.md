# FizzBuzz 
program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

**New Requirements**
- A number is fizz if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
- A number is buzz if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it

## TDD (Test-Driven-Development)
Test-driven development (TDD) is a development technique where you must first write a test that fails before you write new functional code.

**In this project, I have created a maven project. TDD is the approach followed to design and implement a FizzBuzz program. Starting by writing the test cases, to developing the program itself.**

### Implementation:
**Requirements:** 
1. Java 8
2. Junit 4.12
3. Apache Maven 3.6.3
4. IntelliJ IDE 2020.2
